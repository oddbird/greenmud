It's going to be a long winter,
but not long enough.
The book sells like a book,
for love not money,
and Susy is working on the next one.
Her mother has gone home with a hug and farewell,
and a sprinkle of pixie-dust heels-together golden-silver-ruby-rouge slippers.
Susy goes to the lake with a pack of sandwiches
and now-a-major-motion-picture by whatâ€™s-his-name.
It's a good book,
but not good enough,
and she walks out on the frozen water slide.
