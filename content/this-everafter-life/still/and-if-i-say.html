- And if I say just that,
  it hurts so much,
  you have no idea why or what or how.
  You think maybe like stepping on a nail.
  But not actually anything like stepping on a nail.
  Not like anything that hurts.
  Like something that doesn't feel at all,
  or something that feels too much all at once,
  or both.
  Something that can't be followed,
  but must be.
  Like St. Elmoâ€™s will-o-the-wisp foxfire-demon pied-pixie siren,
  calling you, so you move.
  Because cause-and-effect have to exist for me to get from one place to the next.
  And what then,
  if they don't?
  What?
  Am I stuck here forever?
