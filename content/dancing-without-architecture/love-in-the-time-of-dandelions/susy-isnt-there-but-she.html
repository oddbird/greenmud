Susy isnâ€™t there,
but she does call,
and the joy from it lasts almost half a minute or two,
before the shadows and the sun and the world outside have their way again.
What a silly world from where he sits under the trees,
with tears in his eyes.
How dare it go that way again,
after the joy of the holiest of holy winter days,
with snow and gifts and Susy and all.
