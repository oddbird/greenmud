- Iâ€™m calling it a novel.
- About?
- Nothing.
  Anything.
  Tea.
  The smell of ginseng.
  Or something else.
  Will-o-the-wisps.
  The leaves turning and falling.
  The color of the lawn.
  The length of a day.
  The way the sun feels when you stare at it.
  Bright, but red.
  I don't know.
- Do you stare at the sun often?
- No.
- But you write about it?
- Sometimes.
  Once.
  I did.
  You know the feeling.
