After work the next day and the day after
(and several times over the next week)
JJ finds Susy in the parking lot,
and they drive to the park
and sing songs the whole way there and back again, forever.
Itâ€™s a joy,
and a dream,
and being held is everything.

Sundays they sleep in,
and Tuesdays they get up early for a little bit more
before toast and jam
and off to work work work.
