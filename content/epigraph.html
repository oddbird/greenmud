> I once fell in love with you<br />
Just because the sky turned from gray into blue<br />
It was a good Friday<br />
The streets were open and empty<br />
No more passion play<br />
On St. Nicholas avenue<br />
I believe in St. Nicholas<br />
Itâ€™s a different type of Santa Claus
>
> &mdash; Cocorosie, Good Friday
