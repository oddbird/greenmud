    There's more on the way, but we need your help to keep it going.
    <a href="about.html">Teacup Gorilla</a> is ready to write
    the music, and <a href="about.html">OddBird</a> has started writing
    the code, but we need some money to cover our initial costs, and we need
    help spreading the word. We're offering a number of fun, one-of-a-kind
    gifts for anyone who's interested. Join us!
