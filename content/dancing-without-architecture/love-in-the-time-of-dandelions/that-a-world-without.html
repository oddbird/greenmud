> That a world without pain
  is like cheese without jam (juicy jam!)
  And it's time to pick up your sad toys
  and head home (hilly home!)

> With your jam and your cheese
  and your wobbly knees
  and a smile on your frown
  and a wink in your crown
  and a whole load good to go round!
  â€” Just go home! Just go home!
