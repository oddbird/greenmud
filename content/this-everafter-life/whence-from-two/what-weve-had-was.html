> What we've had was had forever
  if not our love then nothing never
  what is true is without measure
  and in-between we'll miss each other.

> And so it goes, and on and on
  this song of love and truth and beauty
  until we say goodnight forever
  and disappear beneath whatever.

> It hardly matters now, then, does it?
