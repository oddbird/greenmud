Sunday was another story,
watching what's-his-name on the tee-tele-vele-vee
in socks and coffee all mid-morning long.

It's the smell,
not the flavor or the kick kick kick
of the beating-heart adrenaline-rush
(sick to the stomach with too much of that),
but a wafting deep-dark-dreamy coffee-canary blue-skies sunny-day smell
in front of a good show
is worth a thousand words.

Smells like tomorrow.
Life is a daydream.
