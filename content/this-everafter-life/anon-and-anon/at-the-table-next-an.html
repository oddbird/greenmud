At the table next,
an older couple read separate newspapers,
now eye-deep in conversation.
This and that.
This and that.
Caffeine.
People come and go.
The waitress bounces wee-wee-wee all the way home.
Barista.
A high school boy,
all the way in the back,
swish-swash-spraying clean the dishes.
Rock sax swings the room around and around.
People come and go.
People come and go.
People.

People are in a novel.
People in a novel come and go.
How does it work?
Why do people in a novel do this?
Why do people not in a novel do that?
Where is this novel going?
Diddle-scribble-scrawl,
and she's off the beaten page.
Reference and style and subject and it's all a blur.
Rob becomes that man in the coffee shop.
Rob has always been that man in the coffee shop.
Rob represents man.
In a coffee shop.
Rob.
