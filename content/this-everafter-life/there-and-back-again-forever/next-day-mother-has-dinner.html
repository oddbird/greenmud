Next day,
Mother has dinner prepped to the teeth and beyond,
in crock pots and dishes and pans and ovens.
With spoons, forks, knives, sporks, whisks and the works.
It's a long day at home alone in the summer,
swith nothing and no one and never. What a to-do to die today.

Or tomorrow,
for what it's worth
(which is quite a lot).
