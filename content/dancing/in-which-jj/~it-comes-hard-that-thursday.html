It comes hard, that Thursday rain, between joy and happiness giving thanks to
a tree stump.

Christmas is just around the corner and JJ can’t complain, much to his
chagrin. When the TV comes on it’s all tinsel and tinseltown, snowstorms and
snowstormstown - white and white and white and whiter. Teeth and smiles and
babies in strollers.

JJ goes for a walk instead.<br />
(with an umbrella this time)
