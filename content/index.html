    <h2>A novel of association, reference, sounds and images.</h2>
    <p>
      It's a new kind of love story. Words move, images shift, and lovers
      wander through the pages. The clouds come and go. And so on. The sun
      moves from the three hand to the four and squirrels are collecting nuts,
      so where does that leave us? Alone and alone and right here together.

    Over the last few years I wrote a novel (with pictures and a new font).
    Now I want to publish that novel online, with animations and music, so you
    can read it and smile and take it with you and share it with friends.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's why I invited you here. I need help making this happen, and I'd like
    you on board. I've already written the words and drawn the pictures.
    Teacup Gorilla is ready to write the music, and OddBird has started writing
    the code. The team's all here, but we need some money to cover our initial
    costs, and we need help spreading the word.
  </p>
  <p>
    Will you join us to fund and share this massive multimedia missive?
    In return, I'd like to offer you any number of fun, one-of-a-kind
    payment/gifts. Because I love you.
