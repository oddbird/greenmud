It's all or nothing, and the latter tonight, with an extra serving for the
road.

Road to nowhere prepping reports for Thursdayâ€™s presentation. The rest is just
details. Don't let us down. Bring up the rear. Dress to kill. What a work week
day. Keep on living, watch the sky turn red. The physics of particles moving
and making contact, touching and loving and falling to the earth in evening
colors of pink and purple: a wedding carpet welcome for the moon and stars.
