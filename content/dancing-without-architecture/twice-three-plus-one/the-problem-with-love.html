- The problem with love it seems,
  if you ask me,
  which you didn't,
  but you should â€”
  I am your best friend after all.
  And so I will tell you anyway,
  As a friend.
  The problem with love is fidelity.
  And I don't mean sex with another man or woman
  (or both, times being what they are),
  because that's not really the point, is it?
  Not the cause,
  but the symptom.
  Not the symptom,
  but the exit strategy.
