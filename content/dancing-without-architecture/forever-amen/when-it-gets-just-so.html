When it gets just so,
out of the oven and ready to edit,
Susy goes at it with knives.
Hungry like wolves for the word kill.
Cut it out,
pare it down,
eat the flesh living off its bones,
and spit them out for later crunching
between cold white teeth.
Make it a game,
like cartwheels and ping pong.
Every third word has got to go -
and so on,
till the end of times-up -
seven o'clock
(or eight, by any other name).
