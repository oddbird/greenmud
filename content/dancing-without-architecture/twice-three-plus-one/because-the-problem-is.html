- Because the problem is you,
  and not them.
  It always is.
  However cheap it sounds when you say it.
  It doesn't last.
  You don't last.
  You can't be one thing forever.
  You were a three and now you’re a seven.
  Twice three plus one more —
  the extra one for your parent's divorce maybe,
  or for no reason at all.
  You're a seven now,
  which is only loosely related to three in a mathematical sense,
  and has nothing in the slightest to say to thirteen,
  so why bother?
