Look at that clock,
always going in circles and never running out of time.
Running, running, running to beat the clock,
and always on time.

JJ makes a joke:
That clock is like me,
always running and never on time.

But the joke doesn't work because JJ isnâ€™t running
and the clock is on time.
He imagines situations in which his joke could work,
with just the right people at just the right moment,
and everyone would laugh,
and he would wear a tie and comb his hair to the side.
What a beautiful time they would all have.

Had by all. Had by all.
