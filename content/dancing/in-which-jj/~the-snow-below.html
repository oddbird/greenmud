> The snow below our heads is cold<br />
that's how we know we're growing old<br />
so sing a song of love and peace<br />
let's lift our heads and wear our fleece.

> Without a song to cheer our hearts<br />
we'll never escape the smells of our farts.

> Christmas is as Christmas does<br />
so kill the ghosts of Christmas was.

> A holiday song for holiday times<br />
holiday holiday holiday rhymes.
