    <h2>A novel of association, reference, sounds and images.</h2>
    <p>
      Words move, images shift, and JJ &amp; Susy wander through the pages.
      The clouds come and go. And so on. Entropy is the passage of more than time.
      Sometimes people. Mostly ketchup. Love is only what it is, and often only a
      shadow of that. The sun moves from the three hand to the four and squirrels
      are collecting nuts, so where does that leave us? Alone and alone and alone.
