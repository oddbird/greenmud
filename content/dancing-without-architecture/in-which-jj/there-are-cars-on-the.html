There are cars on the highway
and some semi truck trailers pulled and pulling
and people moving.
License plates from out of town
and as far west as South Nebraska on a sunny day.
One car is green,
with its blinkers on and latin hip hop like a locomotive.
Here and gone like the rest.
Gone and gone and gone and gone and gone and gone.
