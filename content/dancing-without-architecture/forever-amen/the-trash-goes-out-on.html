The trash goes out on Monday mornings,
just like that.
Nothing to be done.
Picked up and gone,
over the edge of the earth.
The men wear cover-alls to mask their smells.
Keep the clean air clean.
Put the bin outside the door as you leave the office on Fridays
and you'll be fine.
No need to think or breathe.
Take the weekend off and write a novel.
