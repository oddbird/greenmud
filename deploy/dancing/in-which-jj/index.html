          <p>Once upon a Sunday raining afternoon
stood a man without a spoon,
and seeing what his hands be free
he double-dare and climb a&nbsp;tree.</p>
<p>A simple song so sing&nbsp;along!</p>
<p>Oh la la and la again,
surely squirrelly be his friend
and that’s just how this song must&nbsp;end.</p>
<p>[pit pitpit pit pot pitpot pit pit potpit pit potpitpitpot pit pot pitpitpot pit&nbsp;pot]</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>Johnny-John goes sitting on a Sunday bench in the parkest of&nbsp;trees.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>Shadow, shadow, park and shadow. The rain falls slow, and the clouds fall too. <span class="caps">JJ</span> sits and watches the trees. Watches the trees and the rain and the pit pit pit pit pit pot in the puddles&nbsp;before.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>His shirt is wet, and the darkest black hole is his heart. Cries out like a heart. Sad like an afternoon&nbsp;sunset.</p>
<p>The rain falls slow, and the leaves fall&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>(<span class="caps">JJ</span> watches the&nbsp;trees)</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>The park bench sings a little song.And <span class="caps">JJ</span> sits and sings&nbsp;along.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>His heart is gold, his eyes are brown, the hair behind his ears gets wet. He hears the music of the lake and sky sing with the puddles to make him&nbsp;dry.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>But the rain keeps falling, not a squirrel in the sky. No one expects them, and they don’t show. Don’t raining show at all. The sun is hiding, but the shadows show. Shadow, shadow, park and shadow. Johnny-John sits beneath the trees and sings his song. All along. All along. In the park that made him&nbsp;strong.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>Monday: Clear skies. Unearth the little&nbsp;bugger.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>It came hard, that Thursday rain between joy and happiness giving thanks to a tree&nbsp;stump.</p>
<p>Christmas is just around the corner and <span class="caps">JJ</span> can’t complain, much to his chagrin. When the <span class="caps">TV</span> comes on it’s all tinsel and tinseltown, snowstorms and snowstormstown - white and white and white and whiter. Teeth and smiles and babies in&nbsp;strollers.</p>
<p><span class="caps">JJ</span> goes for a walk&nbsp;instead.</p>
<p>(with an umbrella this&nbsp;time)</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>He doesn’t buy anything in the shop windows, or sit in the park bench under the shade of the shadows. When the rain lets up he eats an ice cream cone, but it is cold and sweet. Sweet like a tooth! And he goes home all the same, but a little bit louder. It’s Thursday after&nbsp;all.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>It doesn&#8217;t rain every day in the life of <span class="caps">JJ</span>, and Next Tuesday is one of those days. The fluffy clouds make shapes like rabbits and battleships and dandelions. <span class="caps">JJ</span> doesn’t watch the clouds, but they watch him. He looks like a dot, they might think. Look at that&nbsp;dot.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>There are cars on the highway and some semi truck trailers pulled and pulling and people moving. License plates from out of town and as far west as South Nebraska on a sunny day. It’s warm there, but not too warm and never hot. One car is green, with its blinkers on and latin hip hop like a locomotive. Here and gone like the rest. Gone and gone and gone and gone and gone and&nbsp;gone.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>Like the road to somewheresville do not pass Go Go&nbsp;Go.</p>
<p>Perhaps the future in both directions. Life is a loop like that&nbsp;sometimes.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p><span class="caps">JJ</span> thinks he ought to take a nap on that note. So he sleeps for the afternoon, till the sun goes down and his house is a shadow under the clouds. Then the clouds drift off, and <span class="caps">JJ</span> and his house are shadows all&nbsp;alone.</p>

          <p>At the bookstore on Wednesday, <span class="caps">JJ</span> isn’t sure if he wants the new hardcover by Tuesday’s top seller or the old classic he never read in junior high school. No one enjoyed junior high school, least of all our Johnny-hero John, but he does a lot of reading and he should have read them all by now. Instead, he buys a paperback of poems by someone in their thirties. She’s a recent immigrant or an exile or something else entirely. He likes the cover art and hopes the poems are that good, which they are. It’s well worth the money money money, and he uses a debit card to make the purchase&nbsp;final.</p>

    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>The snow below our heads is cold
that&#8217;s how we know we&#8217;re growing old
so sing a song of love and peace
let&#8217;s lift our heads and wear our&nbsp;fleece.</p>
<p>Without a song to cheer our hearts
we&#8217;ll never escape the smells of our&nbsp;farts.</p>
<p>Christmas is as Christmas does
so kill the ghosts of Christmas&nbsp;was.</p>
<p>A holiday song for holiday times
holiday holiday holiday&nbsp;rhymes.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>The family comes around that Christmas and sits in the living room. Some of them on the couch or in chairs, and some on the hardy-har-hardwood floor with pillows under their&nbsp;bums.</p>
<p>It isn’t a white Christmas, but that’s just as well for the kids who build giant killer robots on the screen, to much greater and long-lasting effect than you or my childhood holiday snowscapes. It also keeps the volume down in the basement with the treadmill and the&nbsp;television.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p><span class="caps">JJ</span>&#8217;s aunt is on the phone quite a bit, and if the British Consulate want to call, well, they’ll just have to wait. Everyone laughs. It’s a merry old Christmas time, with mud and holiday cheer. They even watch a movie and eat sweet things.&nbsp;Delicious.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p><span class="caps">JJ</span> sleeps that whole night through, and then he sleeps the next day&nbsp;too.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>The birds outside make lots of noise and children play and play and play with toys (some of them are&nbsp;boys).</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>What a bore what a bore, what a sleeping little bore. What a bore what a bore, bore bore bore bore bore bore bore. And&nbsp;more!</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>Happy Birthday! call the chimes. But it isn&#8217;t his birthday, it’s almost New Years (when the apples fall). Tick tick tick tick&nbsp;tick.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>Hummm, hum the clouds and the trees hum to. It&#8217;s a whole new world outside in January. And finally the snow comes with ice to keep the world cool. <span class="caps">JJ</span> came awake, it&#8217;s true. Every day since St. Stephen’s, now. What a&nbsp;world!</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>It’s Next Friday already by the time <span class="caps">JJ</span> goes to the park again. He makes snow angels in the snow and sky angels in the sky. He goes sledding on his sled and skating on his skates. It is cold, but his hat keeps his ears warm, and before long he takes off his scarf to give his poor neck some fresh air. The sun is blazing through the cold cold cold like a giant ball of fire, millions of miles&nbsp;away.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>What a day! What a&nbsp;day!</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>The ice is thick, but has cracks running through it. The snow is thick and <span class="caps">JJ</span> runs through it. He builds a snow woman and a fort and another snow man when it’s getting dark. By then he’s hungry and walks home to find a cookie and cocoa and dinner and&nbsp;all.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>A winter wonderland dinner of frozen pizza and veggies all cooked up and hot to the touch. <span class="caps">JJ</span> likes the frozen veggies better than the canned ones - and pizza is as pizza does: good good good. No root beer tonight. None to be had. Do&nbsp;without!</p>
      </div>
    <div id="" class="page">
    
          <p>Merry go round and round and round—
merry go to and fro and fro—
up and down, up and down—
merry go round and round and&nbsp;round.</p>
<p>The sun comes up, the sun goes down
but merry goes round and round and&nbsp;round.</p>
<p>Without sound. Head in the ground. Pitcher&#8217;s mound. Pitcher&#8217;s&nbsp;mound.</p>
