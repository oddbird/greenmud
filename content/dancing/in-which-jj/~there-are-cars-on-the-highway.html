There are cars on the highway and some semi truck trailers pulled and pulling
and people moving. License plates from out of town and as far west as South
Nebraska on a sunny day. Itâ€™s warm there, but not too warm and never hot. One
car is green, with its blinkers on and latin hip hop like a locomotive. Here
and gone like the rest. Gone and gone and gone and gone and gone and gone.
