But the rain keeps falling, not a squirrel in the sky. No one expects them,
and they don’t show. Don’t raining show at all. The sun is hiding, but the
shadows show. Shadow, shadow, park and shadow. Johnny-John sits beneath the
trees and sings his song. All along. All along. In the park that made him strong.
