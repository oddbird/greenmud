It's all or nothing,
and the latter tonight,
with an extra serving for the road.

Road to nowhere
prepping reports for Thursdayâ€™s presentation.
The rest is just details.
Don't let us down.
Bring up the rear.
Dress to kill.
What a work-week day.
Keep on living, watch the sky turn red.
The physics of particles moving and making contact,
touching and loving and falling to the earth
in evening colors of pink and purple:
a wedding carpet welcome for the moon and stars.
