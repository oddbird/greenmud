> Once upon a Sunday raining afternoon      <br />
  stood a man without a spoon,              <br />
  and seeing what my hands be free          <br />
  I double-dare and climb a tree!

> A simple song so sing along!

> Oh la la and la again,                    <br />
  surely squirrelly be my friend            <br />
  and thatâ€™s just how this song must end.
