And she does turn: 
circles every morning as she gets in the shower, 
and sometimes in the bathroom stalls at work. 
Not sure why, 
but surrounded by the off-green shoulder-high Hiny Hider stall dull walls.

(Only nursing homes and stall doors)

Turn turn, and the water is ice now steam: 
a glorious thing hot down the beaten back ahhhhhhhhhhh.
