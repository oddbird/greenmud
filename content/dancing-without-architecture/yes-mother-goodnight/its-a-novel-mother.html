- It's a novel, mother,
  with words and not pictures.
  A real novel,
  with characters who come in and out,
  or stay the whole time over years and through wars,
  loving and hating and dying,
  like Tolstoy and the Russians.
  Like Marquez and others.
  Magic and eternal,
  with such beauty it will make you cry.
