The lamp is broken and the floor squeaks. But hitting snooze is the food of
the gods, and there they all are: Zeus and Jehovah side by side in the light
of Mount Olympus or Zion or one of the others, glowing a bright black shadow
light through clouds and clear sky, floating to the heavens or from them and
back again with sirens blaring and look, there's a squirrel: she has an ice
cream cone and watches TV alone with her mother, now Fred Astaire, and Jehovah
is back, and sheâ€™s downtown with the shadows which become mountains as the
sirens get louder, and Oh Zeus Of Lightning She Is Awake.
