> I once fell in love with you                      </br>
  Just because the sky turned from gray into blue   </br>
  It was a good Friday                              </br>
  The streets were open and empty                   </br>
  No more passion play                              </br>
  On St. Nicholas avenue                            </br>
  I believe in St. Nicholas                         </br>
  It’s a different type of Santa Claus
