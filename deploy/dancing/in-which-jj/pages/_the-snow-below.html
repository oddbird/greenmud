The snow below our heads is cold
that's how we know we're growing old
so sing a song of love and peace
let's lift our heads and wear our fleece.

Without a song to cheer our hearts
we'll never escape the smells of our farts.

Christmas is as Christmas does
so kill the ghosts of Christmas was.

A holiday song for holiday times
holiday holiday holiday rhymes.
