> When the world sits down on a stump
  and looks glum (oh so glum)
  — You go slow. You go slow.
> But the leap of a toad
  is the leap of your soul through the mud (a wild mud!)
  — There you go! There you go!

> And the hum of a bird
  is the hum of your heart in the wild (a wild heart!)
  — So you know! So you know!
