- He needs a woman.
- Sometimes I wonder.
- Something.
- Could be the weather.
- A man then?
- He has a good job.
- All that mud and gray sky.
- In the park and dreaming.
- Crying, I heard.
- In the shadows.
- In the park.
- The same park.
- The same bench.
- He feeds the squirrels.
- The same squirrels.
- What's he dreaming?
