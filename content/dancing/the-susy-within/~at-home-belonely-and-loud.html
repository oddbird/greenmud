At home belonely and loud lays the Susyest 
out and reading on a couch-cushion bed of thoughts.

She's reading a book about the end of the world 
and three young men on adventures through time and the moon. 
Why men? It's always men. 
Put that in your couch cushion and sit on it, Susy. 
Lay on it and fall a full sleep. 
Dream of princesses in battle with the gods for violent freedom 
from blood and guts and washing the kitchen floor 
with numbers from last weekâ€™s stock report.

Someone took your promotion and sat on it. 
Keep your daydream job.
