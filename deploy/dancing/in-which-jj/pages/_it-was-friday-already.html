It’s Next Friday already by the time JJ goes to the park again. He makes snow angels in the snow and sky angels in the sky. He goes sledding on his sled and skating on his skates. It is cold, but his hat keeps his ears warm, and before long he takes off his scarf to give his poor neck some fresh air. The sun is blazing through the cold cold cold like a giant ball of fire, millions of miles away.
