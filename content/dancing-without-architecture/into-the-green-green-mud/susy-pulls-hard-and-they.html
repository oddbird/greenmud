Susy pulls hard and they are off the beaten path.
Blazing their own.
Marching to a beat.
A different heart-drum.
Two of them, together.
Wild like sunshine in the puddles.
Wild like a Sunday morning in June.
Merrily rolling along.
Life is but a green green puddle dream.
Wild like waking up or falling asleep.
The space in-between.
The mud on the feet of the people with hearts.
The wet on the legs of splashing lovers.
Like a fountain!
