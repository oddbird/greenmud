She reads it for JJ who sings it to himself,
changing it a bit here and there,
but loving it all the same.
They sing it together in duet and round,
harmonies up and down and in-between.
Within, and without end.
It's a beautiful sound
in the wilderness-apartment-flat first-floor living-room of Susy's life.
