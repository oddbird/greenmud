  <h2>Anatomy of a demonstration</h2>
  <p>
    I posted the first three chapters to give you a sense of the characters,
    format, and flow of the novel. However, only a few pages are fully designed
    and animated. The remaining pages have simple text, along with a still image
    of the first draft. I've added more page breaks, so some draft images will
    appear on multiple pages.
