At the bookstore on Wednesday, 
JJ isn’t sure if he wants the new hardcover by Tuesday’s top seller 
or the old classic he never read in junior high school. 
No one enjoyed junior high school, 
least of all JJ, 
but he does a lot of reading and he should have read them all by now. 
Instead, he buys a paperback of poems by someone in their thirties. 
She’s a recent immigrant or an exile or something else entirely. 
He likes the cover art and hopes the poems are that good, which they are. 
It’s well worth the money money money, 
and he uses a debit card to make the purchase final.
