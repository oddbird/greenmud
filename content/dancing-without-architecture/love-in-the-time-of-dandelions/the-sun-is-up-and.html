The sun is up and then some,
floating lazy-like through the blue blue blue backstroke sky.
Explain that.

WAKE UP.

JJ is late for work today,
but thatâ€™s ok.

WAKE UP.

The sun and JJ in freestyle together underwater.
Clouds carry them away.
Stars explode.
The earth is swallowed up by the earth.
JJ and Susy in their arms.
They are held.
