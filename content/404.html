## It's not that way.

Perhaps you followed a link to the old Green Mud blog? Turns out I removed
that blog to make room for this <a href="/" rel="home">new and improved
demonstration</a>. Check it out. You can still find all the old posts (and some new
ones) over on <a href="http://eric.andmeyer.com">eric.andmeyer.com</a>.

<a href="/" rel="home" class="home">It's over here!</a>
