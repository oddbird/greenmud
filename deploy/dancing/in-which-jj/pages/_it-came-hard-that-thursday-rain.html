It came hard, that Thursday rain between joy and happiness giving thanks to a tree stump.

Christmas is just around the corner and JJ can’t complain, much to his chagrin. When the TV comes on it’s all tinsel and tinseltown, snowstorms and snowstormstown - white and white and white and whiter. Teeth and smiles and babies in strollers.

JJ goes for a walk instead.

(with an umbrella this time)
