The snow is pushed aside beneath her feet and back when she lays down.
The cold and wet are reminders of coldness and wetness.
The snow is gray forever.
The sky is gray forever.
Where they meet is forever.

She should have brought a pencil,
shouldn't she?
And a sheet of paper.
Write it down like yesterday's poetry.
A silver lining.
A shadow.
Trees.
Evening mass.
Falling asleep.
