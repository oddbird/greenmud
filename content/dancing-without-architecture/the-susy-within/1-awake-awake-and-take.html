1.  Awake awake and take a break.
2.  Sunday's best will have to rest.
3.  These are the days of miracle-popsicle bicycle-brilliant-blue-green
    fairy-tale marmalade-wonderful skies.
4.  Have a tea and sit with me.
5.  Heaven in hand, we'll find our land and settle beneath the trees.
6.  Make no mistake, we'll take a break from all tomorrow's Mondays.
