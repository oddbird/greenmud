The family comes around that Christmas,
and sits in the living room.
Some of them on the couch or in chairs,
and some on the hardy-har-hardwood floor
with pillows under their bums.

It isn’t a white Christmas,
but that’s just as well for the kids
who build giant killer robots on the screen,
to much greater and long-lasting effect
than you or my childhood holiday snowscapes.
It also keeps the volume down in the basement
with the treadmill and the television.
