He sings his song,
as he hums right along,
between the trees and bushes
and the shadows and the shadows and the light and the shadows.
Squirrels above and trees besides,
and everyone together on a grand old adventure
over potholes and under lamp posts
to find his heart
and make it jump jump jump jump jump jump jump!
