Always something to put your mind to,
if you're into that sort of thing.
The view from the window is a maze of light and shadows,
like the park without squirrels.
Like rain on a sunny day.

The numbers don't add up,
but they don't have to.
That's the beauty of it all.
Numbers come and go.
Build them into towers and knock them down.
Timber, she cries out!
Timber!
And they all come a-tumbling down-down-down.
Into the depths of life.
