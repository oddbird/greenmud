# The Project

A story of love, and after-love. 
Eternity is a fickle thing,
and the moments just keep coming.
Clouds shift,
the sun moves past,
and squirrels are collecting nuts,
so where does that leave us?

_Into the Green Green Mud_ 
is an ode to change & impermanence,
both in content and medium.
Starting from a simple text "script"
we are creating a number of inter-related "performances"
in various media.
This version includes text, images, code, and animation,
with a soundtrack that you can download and listen to.
Future versions might include
a printed book,
a live multimedia performance,
sky writing,
or anything else we decide to explore.
