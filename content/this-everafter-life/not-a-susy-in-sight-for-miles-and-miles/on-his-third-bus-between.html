On his third bus between here and west-young-man it's getting late,
but the radio sings along.
The woman in the seat next to him is reading a book,
and so does JJ,
inspired.
Black text on white.
A smooth white.
A new book.
A whole new look.
Just in time.
JJ left his watch behind.

Oh well,
it's for the best.
A stitch in time,
for the rest of time.
Take a rest.
Take a nap.
A book in his lap.
