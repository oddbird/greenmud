<a href="http://oddbird.net/" class="fn org url">OddBird</a> is three brothers
who thrive on freely shared ideas and playful collaboration, crossing
disciplines, breaking boundaries and eating dessert with the soup spoon. They
built Susy for web designers and they are core contributors to Compass,
Django, pip, virtualenv and other open-source projects. These days they’re
building Case Conductor, Mozilla’s new Test Case management system, and they
just wrapped up a mapping tool for The Providence Plan.
