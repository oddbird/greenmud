At home belonely and loud lays the Susyest
out and reading on a couch-cushion bed of thoughts.

She's reading a book about the end of the world,
and three young men on adventures through time and the moon.
Why men? It's always men.
Put that in your couch cushion and sit on it, Susy.
Lay on it, and fall a full sleep.
Dream yourself a princess,
in battle with the gods for violent freedom
from blood and guts and washing the kitchen floor
with numbers from last weekâ€™s stock report.

Someone took your promotion and sat on it.
Keep your daydream job.
