> I once fell in love with you<br />
  Just because the sky turned from gray into blue<br />
  It was a good Friday<br />
  The streets were open and empty<br />
  No more passion play<br />
  On St. Nicholas avenue<br />
  I believe in St. Nicholas<br />
  It’s a different type of Santa Claus

> — Cocorosie, Good Friday
