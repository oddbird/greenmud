    There's more on the way, but I need your help to keep it going.
    <a href="http://www.teacupgorilla.com/">Teacup Gorilla</a> is ready to write
    the music, and <a href="http://www.oddbird.net/">OddBird</a> has started writing
    the code, but we need some money to cover our initial costs, and we need
    help spreading the word. We're offering any number of fun, one-of-a-kind
    gifts for anyone interested in helping out. Because we love you.
