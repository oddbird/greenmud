JJ sits at his computer with headphones and sings to himself.
He hums a christmas little tune,
but those are all worn out.
Something new!
He listens to all his favorites,
and then three more.
Sometimes someone wants to know the procedure
for clearing a document through accounting,
or why the sky is so blue today,
and JJ has answers for everyone.
Other times,
he just listens to his music and nothing gets done.
