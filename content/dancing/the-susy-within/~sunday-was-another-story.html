Sunday was another story, watching what's-his-name on the tee-tele-vele-vee in
socks and coffee all mid-morning long.

It's the smell, not the flavor or the kick kick kick of the beating heart
adrenaline rush. Sick to the stomach with too much of that, but a wafting deep
dark dreamy coffee canary blue-skies sunny day smell in front of a good show
is worth a thousand words.

Smells like tomorrow. Life is a daydream.
