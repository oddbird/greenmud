Nothing to do but list the words, and she does:

1.  The rain and the trees and the humming bird bees.
2.  The wind and the sky and the rain in my eye.
3.  Round and round and round we go.
4.  Through time and rain and wind and snow.
5.  Round and round and round we go.
6.  With love to keep the time.
