Susy pulls hard and they are off the beaten path. Blazing their own. Marching
to a beat. A different heart-drum. Two of them, together. Wild like sunshine
in the puddles. Wild like a Sunday morning in June. Merrily rolling along.
Life is but a green green puddle dream. Wild like waking up or falling asleep.
The space in-between. The mud on the feet of the people with hearts. The wet
on the legs of splashing lovers. Like a fountain!
