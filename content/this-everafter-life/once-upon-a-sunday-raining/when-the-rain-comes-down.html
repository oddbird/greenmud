When the rain comes down with the sun,
out and outside,
the grass is loving it up as green as the day is long.
It's the light of the street lamps through the falling water
that keeps the curtains open.
Back to reading and writing for Susy.
The one and the other,
the both the same.
The one without,
and the other within.
Forever and ever amen,
until bed.

Someone's got to do it.
