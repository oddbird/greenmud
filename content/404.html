## It's not that way.

Perhaps you followed a link to an old blog post? Well, I'm replacing the blog
with <a href="/" rel="home">the novel itself</a>. Check it out, I think you
might like it. You can still find all the old posts (and some new ones) over
on <a href="http://eric.andmeyer.com">eric.andmeyer.com</a>.

<a href="/" rel="home" class="home">It's over here!</a>

</div>
