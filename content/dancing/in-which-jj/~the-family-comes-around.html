The family comes around that Christmas and sits in the living room. Some of
them on the couch or in chairs, and some on the hardy-har-hardwood floor with
pillows under their bums.

It isn’t a white Christmas, but that’s just as well for the kids who build
giant killer robots on the screen, to much greater and long-lasting effect
than you or my childhood holiday snowscapes. It also keeps the volume down in
the basement with the treadmill and the television.
